### Guess • Strategize • Then Guess Again

#### How to play:
1. You will be given a random number at the start of the game. This is the "Number to Guess".
2. There are four crystals below. When you click on a crystal, you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
3. You win the game by matching your total score to the "Number to Guess".
4. You lose the game if your total score goes above the "Number to Guess".
5. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
6. Each time the game starts, you will be given a new random number and the values of each crystal will also change.
